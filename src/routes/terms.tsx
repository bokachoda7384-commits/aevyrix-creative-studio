      <p>Draft terms — to be reviewed before launch.</p>
      <h2 className="pt-4 text-xl font-semibold text-foreground">Inquiries and quotations</h2>
      <p>Submitting an inquiry does not create a binding order. A project is confirmed only after you approve a written quotation and any agreed advance payment is received.</p>
      <h2 className="pt-4 text-xl font-semibold text-foreground">Payments</h2>
      <p>Payment terms (advance, milestones, balance) are stated in each quotation. Third-party costs such as domains, hosting, paid APIs, stock assets, software and ad spend are billed separately.</p>
      <h2 className="pt-4 text-xl font-semibold text-foreground">Revisions and delivery</h2>
      <p>Revision limits and timelines are defined per project. Additional revisions may be charged.</p>
      <h2 className="pt-4 text-xl font-semibold text-foreground">AI-generated content</h2>
      <p>Where AI tools are used, we'll tell you which deliverables are AI-generated and which are produced by our team.</p>
